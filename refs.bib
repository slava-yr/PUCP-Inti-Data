	abstract = {"The experimental infrastructure of GEDERlab, an energy hub located at the Polytechnic University of Valencia (UPV), was used to develop and validate photovoltaic power prediction models. This environment was specifically designed to integrate, operate, and monitor different renewable energy sources, including solar photovoltaic, wind, hydroelectric, and biomass. Thanks to its real-time energy and meteorological data acquisition system, it provides an ideal setting for evaluating the performance of solar systems under real-world, controlled conditions.The laboratory's photovoltaic installation is composed of nine SERAPHIM SRP-310-E11B solar panels, each with a power of 310 W (STC) and 230 W (NOCT), providing a total peak power of approximately 2.1 kW. These panels are installed on the roof of the building, in a strategic position to efficiently capture incident solar radiation. The system is complemented by a Schneider Conext MPPT 60 150 charge regulator, responsible for optimally managing the energy flowing to the batteries, thus prolonging their useful life. In addition, a Schneider Conext XW+ inverter is included, which transforms the direct current generated by the panels into alternating current usable by the system or for grid injection.To correlate energy production with weather conditions, the lab uses a Davis Vantage Pro2 weather station, also located on the rooftop. This station continuously records key meteorological variables such as solar radiation, ambient temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Data is collected automatically at one-minute intervals, ensuring adequate temporal resolution for detailed modeling and analysis.All the information generated by both the production systems and the weather station is stored in a structured database. This continuous collection system provides an extensive and accurate historical record, essential for identifying patterns of behavior, establishing relationships between variables, and training reliable prediction models. Furthermore, this database constitutes a strategic tool for decision-making, optimizing energy efficiency, and extrapolating results to real-life scenarios, facilitating the study's replicability in other similar facilities.The dataset presented comes directly from the photovoltaic installation described above. The dataset covers 26 days, from 11{\textbackslash}/01{\textbackslash}/2024 to 11{\textbackslash}/26{\textbackslash}/2024, inclusive. In this case, the separation is arbitrary, so that 21 days are used to train the models and 5 days to validate them. A high-resolution time series, with a frequency of one minute, is then available, including three key variables: the power generated by the system, the ambient temperature, and the global irradiance.These records reflect in great detail the plant's operating behaviour under real-world conditions, including rapid variations due to meteorological phenomena such as variable cloud cover or temperature changes."},

	abstract = {Accurately determining single-diode model parameters yields essential insights into the photovoltaic (PV) device performance and behavior. Analytical methods for extracting these parameters often rely on mathematical assumptions typically valid under controlled indoor conditions. Applying these methods to PV modules in the field introduces complexities due to varying environmental conditions and module technologies, leading to divergencies between parameters extracted under outdoor and indoor conditions. This study closes the gap in analyzing the retrieved parameters under intricate outdoor conditions by differentiating between all-, clear-, and cloudy-sky conditions and varying irradiances for different PV technologies. We examine three methods over a year of outdoor I-V curves from Al-BSF, HIT, and a-Si/µc-Si PV modules in Lima, Peru, a low-latitude site. The findings represent the first mid-term study by the country’s premier laboratory uniquely equipped for diverse outdoor PV module characterization. We evaluate the accuracy of each method using the Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) by comparing experimental against simulated I-V curves derived from the extracted parameters. Our findings reveal that the parameters for the Al-BSF and HIT modules under all-sky conditions align with reported outdoor trends for varying irradiances, while under clear skies, they correspond with indoor trends. In terms of accuracy, the methods by Phang et al. and de Blas et al. consistently achieve an average NRMSE below 1 \% across all PV module types under all-sky conditions. However, when differentiating between sky conditions, the NRMSE values for the Al-BSF and HIT modules are notably lower under clear sky conditions at any irradiance level, preserving a mean value below 0.6 \%, unlike the a-Si/µc-Si PV technology, which shows more consistent NRMSE values across all sky conditions and most irradiance levels and in average above 0.7 \%. These results demonstrate that selecting sky conditions based on the evaluated PV technology is beneficial for enhanced accuracy in outdoor parameter extraction.},

This characterization is an extension of methods developed for monofacial modules by considering the IEC TS 60904-1-2 standard for bifacial modules, particularly the introduction of the equivalent irradiance that accounts for albedo and bifaciality. We extract the short-circuit current, open-circuit voltage, and maximum power from the module I-V characteristic curve under outdoor conditions. We extrapolate these parameters to standard test conditions using the measured equivalent irradiance and module temperature. This method is applied on bifacial modules in two mounting orientations: 15° tilt north-oriented and vertical east-west orientation. Characterizing the bifacial modules’ electrical parameters using the proposed approach yields results with similar accuracy as applying the equivalent characterization of a tilted monofacial module.},

	abstract = {Lately, the photovoltaics community has shown an increased interest in overirradiance conditions as there is the possibility that such conditions might lead to malfunctions in photovoltaic systems. Varying irradiance levels, recurrence, and duration of such conditions have been reported worldwide, but experimental studies on the spectral distribution of overirradiance conditions are still scarce. This work analyses measured spectral irradiance of overirradiance conditions along with spectra under clear and cloudy sky conditions in three different sites at low- (Lima-Peru) and mid-latitudes (Madrid-Spain and Berlin-Germany) collected for two years. The Average Photon Energy (APE) was used as a representative index of the spectral distribution. For each site, taking the APE under clear sky into account as a reference, it could be shown that the spectra under cloudy skies are blue-shifted, and the overirradiance spectra are red-shifted independently of the location. The red-shift is proportional to the irradiance enhancement intensity. In addition, all sites have different degrees of blue–shift for cloudy skies, with Lima, Madrid, and Berlin exhibiting a difference in APE compared to clear sky conditions of 17 meV, 38 meV, and 43 meV on average, respectively. This difference in APE for the overirradiance conditions compared to clear sky conditions is also independent of the location with a mean value of (8 ± 1) meV. These spectral shift observations experimentally confirm prior assumptions that overirradiance conditions predominantly cause an enhancement of the direct spectral irradiance.},

	abstract = {Field-based assessment of photovoltaic (PV) module performance provides key insights for accurate lifespan prediction and reliability analysis. However, two significant research gaps remain: the scarcity of long-term evaluations in low-latitude regions and the limited application of established ensemble methods under diverse climatic conditions. This study presents a long-term field performance analysis of eight PV technologies installed in Lima, Peru, a subtropical desert climate at low latitude. Module Performance Ratio (MPR) was evaluated considering the effects of measured temperature and spectral variations. For c-Si-based modules, thermal losses ranged from 2.7 \% to 4.3 \%, while thin-film modules exhibited smaller thermal impacts ( 2.2 \% to 2.6 \%). Spectral losses in c-Si modules ranged from 0.7 \% to 1.5 \%. Conversely, a-Si modules recorded spectral gains of 5.7 \%. Additional analysis of open-circuit voltage, short-circuit current, and fill factor revealed distinct performance degradation pathways across technologies. Ensemble-derived Performance Loss Rates (PLR), combined with climate-influencing factors, enabled benchmarking and 25-year energy yield projections. Our reported PLRs of up to 1.61 \%/year for c-Si slightly exceed reported global-median PLRs, suggesting detrimental effects of Lima’s high humidity and UV exposure. Projections indicate that in Lima HIT modules may outperform IBC and PERT technologies, underscoring the value of region-specific, long-term PV performance studies.},

For this study, a new outdoor-PV laboratory was implemented at the Pontificia Universidad Católica del Perú (PUCP) with the help of the IDEA research group of the University of Jaén (UJA), Spain. The laboratory enables the characterization of PV modules by extracting the electrical parameters from the current-voltage (I-V) curve under outdoor conditions and by measuring the irradiance, the spectral distribution, the panel temperature, and the weather conditions. As a first step, the nominal maximum power of the PV modules under standard test conditions is obtained from the outdoor data. Then, an analysis of the different PV technologies’ performance under the local climate conditions is presented by applying the Osterwald and the constant fill factor methods to compare the modeled and experimental maximum power.},
